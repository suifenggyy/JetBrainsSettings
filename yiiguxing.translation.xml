This is the primitive type specialization of {@link BinaryOperator} for {@code long}. &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html&quot;&gt;functional interface&lt;a&gt; whose functional method is {@link applyAsLong(long, long)}." />
      <item value="A stage of a possibly asynchronous computation, that performs an action or computes a value when another CompletionStage completes. A stage completes upon termination of its computation, but this may in turn trigger other dependent stages. The functionality defined in this interface takes only a few basic forms, which expand out to a larger set of methods to capture a range of usage styles: &lt;ul&gt;" />
